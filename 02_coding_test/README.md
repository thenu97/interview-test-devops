# Coding Test

## Brief
Build a basic tool in Python, Ruby or another language of your choice that does _something_ you'd normally end up having to do manually. Some ideas:

* Backing up a database and sending the output to a cloud storage solution.
* A basic API to provide you with some useful information.
* Getting some information back from an external source and presenting it to the end user.

Again, bonus points:

* If you're using third-party packages, make sure to use a packaging solution such as Pipenv or Bundler.
